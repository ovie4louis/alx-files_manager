Inside the folder utils, create a file redis.js that contains the class RedisClient.

RedisClient should have:

the constructor that creates a client to Redis:
any error of the redis client must be displayed in the console (you should use on('error') of the redis client)
a function isAlive that returns true when the connection to Redis is a success otherwise, false
an asynchronous function get that takes a string key as argument and returns the Redis value stored for this key
an asynchronous function set that takes a string key, a value and a duration in second as arguments to store it in Redis (with an expiration set by the duration argument)
an asynchronous function del that takes a string key as argument and remove the value in Redis for this key
After the class definition, create and export an instance of RedisClient called redisClient.
